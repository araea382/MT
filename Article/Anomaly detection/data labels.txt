The labels associated with a data instance denote whether that instance is normal or
anomalous. It should be noted that obtaining labeled data that is accurate as well
as representative of all types of behaviors, is often prohibitively expensive. Labeling
is often done manually by a human expert and hence substantial effort is required to
obtain the labeled training data set. Typically, getting a labeled set of anomalous data
instances that covers all possible type of anomalous behavior is more difficult than
getting labels for normal behavior. Moreover, the anomalous behavior is often dynamic
in nature, for example, new types of anomalies might arise, for which there is no labeled
training data. In certain cases, such as air traffic safety, anomalous instances would
translate to catastrophic events, and hence are very rare.
