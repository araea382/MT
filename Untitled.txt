We also remark however that BIC is based on approximating the distribution of the MLE by a Normal, and may be unreliable, as exemplified by Scott (2002, Section 4.1), for data of small or moderate size.


Hence, lower BIC implies either fewer explanatory variables, better fit, or both. 


When the residuals are not normally distributed, then the hypothesis that they are a random dataset, is .NOT TRUE.

This means that in that case your (regression) model does not explain all trends in the dataset. I guess, you don´t want unkown trends to remain in your dataset. I would feel uncomfortable with that, because this would mean that your model is not fully explaining the behaviour of your system.

Only solution is to find a model that fully explains the behaviour of your system.  That means that you have to find a model, that shows residuals which are,... yes indeed, normally distributed. 

Why do the residuals need to be normal when carrying out multi level modeling?. Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/post/Why_do_the_residuals_need_to_be_normal_when_carrying_out_multi_level_modeling [accessed May 8, 2017].
