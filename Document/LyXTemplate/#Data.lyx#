 The company provides services, software products and infrastructure related
 to information and communications technology (ICT).
 Its head quarter is located in Stockholm, Sweden.
 Ericsson continuously expands its services and products beyond telecoms

LTE, widely known as 4G, is the Long-Term Evolution of the 3G network.
 The high-level network architecture of LTE is shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and is described as follows 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The E-UTRAN, an official standard name for the radio access network of
 LTE, is the entire network.
 It handles the radio communication between the User Equipment, UE, or mobile
 device and the evolved base stations called eNB.
 Each eNB is a base station which controls and manages radio communications
 with multiple devices in one or more cells.
 Several base stations are connected to a Mobility Management Entity, MME,
 which handles the high-level operation of the mobile for different UEs.
 MME establishes a connection and runs a security application to ensure
 that the UE is allowed on the network.
 In LTE mobile network, multiple UEs connect to a single base station.
 A new UE performs a cell search procedure by searching for an available
 eNB when it first connects to the network.
 Then, the UE sends information about itself to establish a link between
 the UE and the eNB.

Ericsson makes a global 
\emph on
software release
\emph default
 in roughly 6-month cycles or two major releases per year.
 Each of these releases contains a bundle of features and functionality
 that is intended for all the customers.
 The software release is labeled with 
\emph on
L
\emph default
 followed by a number related to the year of release and a letter either
 
\emph on
A
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
B
\emph default
 which generally corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $1^{st}$

 half of that year.
 Ericsson opens up a track for each software release and begins a code integrati
on track.
 This track becomes the main track of the work or the focal branch for all
 code deliveries.
 There are hundreds of teams producing code and code is committed to this
 track continuously.
 In order to create a structure for this contribution, a daily 
\emph on
software package
\emph default
 is built.
 Every day a new software package is built which can be seen as a snapshot
 or a marker in the continuous delivery timeline.
 This software package is then run through various automated test loops
 to ensure that there are no faults in the system.
 The software packages are named 
\emph on
R
\emph default
 followed by one or more numbers, which is then followed by one or more
 letters.
 
\emph on
R
\emph default
 stands for Release-state.
 To summarize, each software package is the snapshot in the code integration
 timeline.

There are thousands of automated tests performed.
 Each test belongs to a particular suite of tests, which belongs to a particular
 quality assurance (QA) area.
 For this thesis framework, one suite of test cases that test the signaling
 capacity within QA Capacity is focused.
 The QA Capacity has the responsibility of testing and tracking test cases
 related to LTE node capacity.
 Each one of these test cases has a well-defined traffic model it tries
 to execute.
 The traffic model in this context means certain intensity (per second)
 of procedures, which can be seen as stimuli in the LTE node.
 The LTE node then increments one or more counters for each one of these
 procedures or stimuli it detects.
 These counters are called local events and they are represented by EventsPerSec.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A logging loop is started during the execution of these test cases of QA
 Capacity – signaling capacity.
 The logging loop collects a bunch of metrics, and a subset of these metrics
 is what this thesis is currently studied with.
 Once the logging loop is finished, it is written to a log file.
 Then, there are cron jobs that crawl through this infrastructure once a
 day to find latest logs and do a post-processing.
 The final output of these are either the CSV data or JSON encoded charts.
 The flowchart of this process is illustrated in

This is the data for the second generation (G2) product which contain 2,781
 test cases.
 The data is collected on 20 January 2017 and is extracted from log file
 produced by test cases.
 There are different types of test cases which are being executed in the
 automated test suites.
 Each test case is viewed as an observation in the data.
 Following are the variables in the data:

This variable contains several local events that can be used when defining
 the test case.
 Apparently, there is no fixed number of local events in this variable as
 different test cases involve additional procedure compared to other test
 cases.
 The local events along with their values are also varied depending on which
 types of test cases are being executed.
 An example of the local events in test cases is shown in

Data preprocessing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data consists of three software releases – L16A, L16B and L17A – and
 it is split into a dataset according to the software release.
 The dataset is sorted by the version of the software package which is named
 alphabetically.
 Even though the dataset has a timestamp when the test case is run, the
 timestamp is unsuitable to represent itself as a time point in time series.
 The software package is an important variable and more of an interest to
 this analysis.
 Therefore, it is viewed as the data points indexed in time order in the
 time series.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Why is it unsuitable? give one reason
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Test cases are not always being executed properly.
 It is either no traffic is generated during the test case or that data
 is not logged.
 If the EventsPerSec field is missing or has no value in it, the test case
 is being treated as incomplete and all the data related to that particular
 test case is ignored.
 This also applied for other cases when any fields in the dataset is missing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eventspersec"

\end_inset

, it can be seen that EventsPerSec variable stores multiple values separated
 by a tab character.
 These tab-separated values in the field are split to columns.
 The process is done in order to get its local events and values which character
ized the test case and later on used for fitting the Markov switching model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each software release consists of several software packages.
 Also, numerous test cases are executed in one software package.
 Since the software package acts as a point in time in the time series,
 it appears to be rather difficult to visualize all results from every executed
 test case for each software package.
 Hence, the test case which has the lowest value of the CPU utilization
 (or minimum value of TotCpu%) is selected to represent the performance
 of a specific software package.
 Although taking an average of the multiple runs for test cases in the software
 package appears to be a good approach, it does not yield the best outcome
 in this case.
 The first reason is that manipulating data can easily be misleading.
 It is, therefore, settled to remain the data as it is and always visualize
 the data exactly as it is recorded.
 Another important reason for not using the average value of the CPU utilization
 is because the essential information in the test case will be lost.
 Each test case has its own local events in EventsPerSec field that used
 for identifying the test case.
 The details of these local events are absent when averaging over the CPU
 utilization of the test cases in the software package.

The reason for choosing the minimum value of the CPU utilization is because

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After performing all the steps describing above, the dataset of software
 release L16A, L16B and L17A consist of 64, 241, and 144 test cases, respectivel
y.
 Lastly, each dataset with particular software release is divided into two
 subsets.
 Ninety percent of the dataset is used for training the model and the remaining
 ten percent is left out for testing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some variables in the data are chosen to be used for further analysis.
 There are in total one response variable and six predictor variables.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "data"

\end_inset

 shows the name of variables and their description.
 The first three predictor variables are local events of the test case which
 can be found in the EventsPerSec while the last three variables are considered
 as the test environment.
 These variables appear to have a high contribution to the CPU utilization.
