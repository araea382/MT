 It has been studied over decades as it is a problem of interest in many
 applications in which the characteristics of data is collected over time.
 Change point detection can be utilized in medical condition monitoring

 should be able to identify when something went wrong (i.e., defective products,
 machine breakdowns).
 Methods are also useful in signal processing to detect the significant
 change in the streaming data

In this study, change point detection will be used to identify the changes
 in performance of Ericsson's system.
 Many test runs have been executed for testing the software packages in
 the simulation environment.
 Before launching product to customer, they need to test how well do the
 software package perform.
 The performance of these software packages are evaluated by considering
 on the CPU utilization, a percent of the CPU's cycle that spent on each
 process, and some other metrics (e.g., memory usage, latency).
 CPU utilization is one of the main focus in the test run that need to be
 optimized for the released of upgrade software package.

\begin_layout Standard
There are two approaches, parametric and nonparametric analysis, for detecting
 the change point in time series.
 Parametric analysis benefits from assuming some knowledge of data distribution
 and integrates it to the detection scheme.
 On the other hand, nonparametric analysis has lessened a restriction/ is
 more flexible in which there is no assumption made about the distribution.
 It can, therefore, apply to a wider range of application and capturing
 various kinds of changes.
 Generally, real-world applications do not always have a well-defined structure
 and most of the time they are no known distributional form which give a
 real advantage for applying the nonparametric approach

Change point detection has a bottom line for discovering and estimating
 the time point where the changes in time series occur.
 The change should be flagged as soon as it happened in order to properly
 deal with such changes in time and reduce the consequences.

The main idea of this thesis is to reduce the laborer work to do visual
 inspection whenever they want to analyze the performance of update software
 package.
 With the rise of data generation and a large number of test runs, this
 work becomes more difficult and perhaps inefficient to do it manually.
 This is when Machine learning, the algorithm that has an ability to learn
 from data, comes into focus.
 The main objectives for this thesis is to implement machine learning to
 analyze the performance of the system.
 The algorithm will help indicate whether the performance of software package
 is degradation, improvement or in a steady state.
 There is also a case when the changes in the test environment affect performanc
e even though there is no change in the software package.
 The implemented algorithm should be able to detect when the test environment
 is altered.

To summarize, this thesis aims to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Detect the degradation, improvement or steady state in CPU Utilization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Detect whether there is some changes in test environment that impact on
 CPU Utilization
