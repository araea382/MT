\begin_layout Standard
A thorough search of the relevant literature yielded that this might be
 the first time that Markov switching model is applied on the data which
 is not related to financial time series or signal processing.
 A large amount of time is spent on understanding the data and determining
 which methods would be the best fit to this problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One thing worth mentioning is that it is better to always try estimating
 simple models first.
 The model's size grows exponentially according to the number of state 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, and the number of predictor variables.
 There would be more parameters to be estimated if parameters also have
 switching effects.
 The obtained results probably be a local maximum and cannot be completely
 trusted

\begin_layout Standard
It is found earlier that in the dataset of software release L16A, there
 is one variable which is an exact linear combination of the other variables.
 Hence, the variable is excluded from the regression model.
 used only 57 test cases in training the model.
 The data or in this case number of test cases in each software release
 is rather small which make it easier for an occurrence of singularity.
 Therefore, unless there is more data, it is better to drop the variable
 from the regression model before doing a further analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One has to understand and accept a risk when deciding on the number of states.
 There is no guarantee how many states would yield the best outcome, and
 the one which is more appealing is selected.
 The same situation also applies when determining the number of switching
 coefficient in the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Markov switching model with four states is also tested in the analysis but
 results are rather poor compare to the model with two and three states.
 The four-state model causes more difficulty and perhaps impossible to make
 an inference on the states.

Residual analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One benefit from using the non-parametric analysis is that it does not require
 a prior assumption of the data distribution.
 This analysis is able to detect any type of distributional change within
 a time series.
 In this thesis framework, the non-parametric analysis is used for comparing
 with the results from Markov switching model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The computational time of the E-divisive algorithm is 
\begin_inset Formula $O(kT^{2})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the number of estimated change points and 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is the number of observation in the time series data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The accuracy of the test set in simulated data is significantly high.
 One reason for that might be because of this simulated data has some kinds
 of pattern.
 The model is able to capture the behavior of the time series data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Model selection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model for each dataset which have all switching parameters acts as a
 baseline model in the analysis.
 In other words, this model is used to compare with other models with different
 combination of switching coefficients.
 If the fitted model has higher BIC value than the baseline model it means
 that the model performs worst and should not be considered.

\begin_layout Paragraph*

\begin_layout Standard
Even though model 3 has the lowest BIC value, it is found in the output
 that the coefficient of Paging has zero standard error leading t-value
 to infinity (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Output"

\end_inset

).
 This zero value can be interpreted in two different ways: an actual zero
 or treated as zero because significant digit is lost due to the floating
 point.
 Nevertheless, either way suggests that this model might not be a good one.
 Therefore, model 1 which is the second lowest BIC is chosen for this given
 dataset instead.

\begin_layout Standard
When choosing model for the data, it is insufficient to only look at the
 BIC value.
 Other aspects should also be taken into consideration.
 For instance, model 2 has the smallest BIC value this could be a but graph
 is not interpretable
