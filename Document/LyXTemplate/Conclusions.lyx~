\begin_layout Chapter
Conclusions 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis assesses an ability of detecting any changes in the performance
 of the Ericsson's software products by applying the Markov switching autoregres
sive model and the E-divisive method.
 The simulated datasets with known states were used to make a comparison
 between both methods.
 The results from applying the Markov switching model to the real data were
 presented with interpretations and discussions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the Markov switching model, the number of states and the number of switching
 coefficients in the model were determined and chosen by examining the BIC,
 along with model outputs and plots.
 The findings from the simulated datasets revealed that the Markov switching
 model were able to discover switches between states rather well, despite
 some false alarms and missed detections.
 This method works well even though numerous switches between states did
 occur

 in the data.
 The E-divisive method is less powerful compared to the Markov switching
 model.
 The method could identify fewer change point locations, and failed to detect
 many changes that were occurred

 in the simulated datasets.
 The E-divisive method will perform better and will be more efficient if
 the data have an obvious pattern of shifting in the time series.
 Based on the results from the simulated datasets and the real data, the
 Markov switching model was considered to be the suitable method for the
 analysis.
 The E-divisive method was rather used as a guideline for any changes that
 could happen in the data.
 The method could also be used together with the Markov switching model
 for a confirmation of the changes in the data when the actual state is
 unknown.
 After applying the Markov switching model to both simulated datasets, the
 accuracy of the test sets implied that an implementation of a state prediction
 function appears to work well.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Moreover, an implementation of a state prediction function appears to functional
ly work well when investigating on the simulated datasets.
 The accuracy from both simulated datasets were high.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Evaluating the obtained results is rather difficult, mostly due to a lack
 of annotations or label of the state of the CPU utilization.
 This is a common situation to an unsupervised learning problem where the
 ground truths are not often available.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Besides, another difficulty of using the Markov switching model is that
 a state inference is required.
 Since the Markov switching model assumed latent states, a sensible inference
 is needed in order to get a final and meaningful result that can be further
 used.
\end_layout

\end_inset

To conclude, this work has provided knowledge to understand more about the
 properties of the state of the CPU utilization which will, in turn, pave
 the way for further analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Future work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Markov switching model gave quite promising results but several improvements
 could also be done to increase the robustness of the analysis.
 For future work, more extensive data is recommended.
 Obtained results will be more reliable as additional information will decrease
 an uncertainty in the data.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As the assumption of the distribution of residuals was not entirely fulfill,
 significant details that were used to explained the CPU utilization might
 not all be caught by the model.
 Hence, another future extension is to consider on the effects of interaction
 terms or the other predictor variables, specifically local events in 
\emph on
EventsPerSec
\emph default
, that might have an effect on the CPU utilization.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, there are still two more performance metrics in QA Capacity
 area which have not been taken into account in the thesis i.e., memory usage
 and latency.
 The analysis could also be extended to analyze these metrics in a further
 work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another future extension to get a more interpretable results and the best
 state prediction is to consider applying the Markov switching model on
 the different QA Capacity test case types i.e., one model for each type of
 test case.
 Results are expected to be more accurate as value of the CPU utilization
 will be slightly more stable and not so fluctuating.
 The analysis of restricted the data to a specific test case type is proved
 to be a good approach as the analysis was briefly tested with the software
 release B.
 The results are presented in the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "chap:Output"

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would also be interesting to use normalized values by introducing weight
 parameters instead of using the real value of the local events in the 
\emph on
EventsPerSec
\emph default
 and the CPU utilization.
 Different weights can be given to the local events depending on how much
 effect it has on the CPU utilization.
 These values are summed up and then divided by the CPU utilization value
 to get a final value that represents a value with respect to a specific
 type of test case and the CPU utilization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, in the future if some test cases have been labeled by an area expert,
 a semi-supervised learning algorithm, a technique that falls between supervised
 and unsupervised learning, could also be implemented.
 Training a model with a large amount of unlabeled data and a small amount
 of labeled data could considerably improve the accuracy of the model.
 The semi-supervised learning could be of good practical use, especially
 for applications where labeling all the data is very expensive and time-consumi
ng.
