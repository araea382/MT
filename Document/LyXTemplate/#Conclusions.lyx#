\begin_layout Chapter
Conclusions 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis assesses the ability of detecting the performance of the Ericsson's
 software products by applying the Markov switching autoregressive model,
 and the E-divisive method which is an approach in the non-parametric analysis.
 The simulated data with known state are used for the comparison between
 both methods.
 The results from the real data are presented with interpretations and discussio
ns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the Markov switching model, the number of states and the number of switching
 coefficients in the model were determined and chosen by examining the BIC,
 along with model outputs and plots.
 The findings from the simulated data revealed that the Markov switching
 model is able to discover the switches between states rather well despite
 some false alarms and missed detections.
 On the contrary, the E-divisive method is less powerful compare to the
 Markov switching model.
 The method failed to detect many changes in the data.
 The E-divisive method performs better and more efficient if data have an
 obvious pattern of shifting in the time series.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, an implemented function of the state prediction appear to functionally
 work well when investigating on the simulated data.
 The accuracy from both simulated datasets were high.
 From performing both methods in the simulated data and the real data, the
 results from the Markov switching model was considered to be the representative
 for the analysis.
 The E-divisive method was generally used as a guideline and also a confirmation
 for a change in the CPU state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Evaluating the obtained results is rather difficult and complicated, mostly
 due to a lack of annotations or label of the state of the CPU.
 This is a common situation to an unsupervised learning problem where the
 ground truth is not often available.
 Besides, another difficulty of the Markov switching model usage is that
 a state inference is required.
 Since the Markov switching model assumed a latent state, a sensible inference
 is needed in order to get a final and meaningful results that can be further
 used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Further work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Markov switching model gave quite a promising result but several improvement
s could also be done to increase a robustness of the analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For future work, using more observations in the data is recommended.
 Obtained results will be more reliable as additional information will decrease
 an uncertainty in the data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another future extension is to consider on other predictor variables or
 interaction terms that might also have an effect on the CPU utilization.
 As the assumption of the distribution of residuals was not entirely fulfill,
 significant details that were used to explained the CPU utilization might
 not all be caught by the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, there are still two more performance metrics in QA Capacity
 area which have not been taken into account in the thesis (e.g., a memory
 usage and a latency).
 The analysis could also be extended to analyze these metrics in a further
 work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, in the future if some test cases have been labeled by a domain
 expert, a semi-supervised learning algorithm, a technique that falls between
 a supervised learning and an unsupervised learning, could also be implemented.
 Training a model with a large amount of unlabeled data and a small amount
 of labeled data could considerably improving an accuracy of the model.
 The semi-supervised learning could be of good practical use especially
 to an application where labeling all the data is very expensive and time-consum
ing.

This line indicates the amount of time the CPU spent in each of several
 states, displayed as percentages.
 The numbers reflect the percentage of the time since the last screen update
 that the CPU spent in each state.
