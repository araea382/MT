\begin_layout Standard
A thorough search of the relevant literature yielded that this might be
 the first time that Markov switching model is applied on the data used
 in the thesis to detect the state of the CPU.
 In previous work, this model is mainly implemented in finance or signal
 processing.
 A large amount of time is spent on understanding the data and determining
 which methods would be the best fit to this problem.
 Besides, a lot of work is done when trying to study implemented algorithms
 in the R package and also modify code as necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, NodeName, which is used to execute test cases, is assumed
 to be indifferent i.e., performance of test cases are the same regardless
 of the machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One thing worth mentioning is that when modeling the Markov switching model,
 it is better to try estimating simple models first.
 The model's size grows exponentially according to the number of state 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, and the number of predictor variables.
 Switching coefficients also 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There would be more parameters to be estimated if parameters also have switching
 effects.
 The obtained results probably be a local maximum and cannot be completely
 trusted

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mention previously in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:States"

\end_inset

, there is one variable in the dataset of software release L16A which is
 an exact linear combination of the other variables.
 Hence, the variable is excluded from the regression model.
 This dataset has 57 test cases for training the Markov switching model.
 The data or in this case number of test cases in each software release
 is rather small which make it easier for an occurrence of singularity.
 Therefore, unless there is more data, it is better to drop the variable
 from the regression model before doing a further analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One has to understand and accept a risk when deciding on the number of states.
 There is no guarantee how many states would yield the best outcome, and
 the one which is more appealing is selected.
 The same situation also applies when determining the number of switching
 coefficients in the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Markov switching model with four states is also tested in the analysis but
 results are rather poor compare to the model with two and three states.
 The four-state model causes more difficulty and perhaps impossible to make
 an inference on the states.

Three-state is more interpretable because ...

Residual analysis -> It reveals that residual does not completely follow
 a normal distribution -> remember that dataset is not large -> hard to
 spot a basic feature -> representing some noise -> with small samples often
 situation may be less clearer

Furthermore, the model is able to capture the pattern of data rather well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
heavy tail = high variance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is an outlier in the residuals (2004:Q4) which suggests there was
 something unusual happening in that quarter.
 It would be worth investigating that outlier to see if there were any unusual
 circumstances or events that may have reduced beer production for the quarter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The remaining residuals show that the model has captured the patterns in
 the data quite well, although there is a small amount of autocorrelation
 left in the residuals (seen in the significant spike in the ACF plot).
 This suggests that the model can be slightly improved, although it is unlikely
 to make much difference to the resulting forecasts.

\begin_layout Standard
model validation -> if the residuals appear to behave randomly, it suggests
 that the model fits the data well
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
randomness tends to obscure the true behavior especially with small data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assumption of a normally distributed residuals is justified for software
 release L16B.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Q-Q plot is used to check the assumption.
 It is a visual check that provides a rough idea whether the assumption
 is plausible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One benefit from using the non-parametric analysis is that it does not require
 a prior assumption of the data distribution.
 This analysis is able to detect any type of distributional change within
 a time series.
 In this thesis framework, the non-parametric analysis is used for comparing
 with the results from Markov switching model.

\begin_layout Standard
The computational time of the E-divisive algorithm is 
\begin_inset Formula $O(kT^{2})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the number of estimated change points and 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is the number of observation in the time series data.

take into account only the CPU utilization (or TotCpu% variable)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The accuracy of the test set in simulated data is significantly high.
 One reason for that might be because of this simulated data has some kinds
 of pattern.
 The model is able to capture the behavior of the time series data.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nevertheless, it is important to note that the model output could be potentially
 affected by various kinds of bias.
 First, the model is trained in a quite small sample size that may not be
 representative for all the world sites.
 For example, sites with extreme cold or warm temperatures or high altitude
 may be wrongly estimated.
 Generally, models cannot guarantee accurate predictions for new observations
 that lie outside the range of the trained data.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Model selection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this analysis, a model with all switching coefficients, which is a three-stat
e model from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:States"

\end_inset

, acts as a baseline model for each dataset.
 This model is used to compare with other models which have different combinatio
n of switching coefficients in a particular dataset.
 If the fitted model has higher BIC than the baseline model, it means that
 this specific model performs worst and should not be considered for further
 analysis.
 However, it is insufficient to only look at the BIC when choosing model
 for the data.
 Other aspects should also be taken into consideration such as model outputs
 or graph.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Software release L16A
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though model 3 has the lowest BIC, it is found in the output (not reported)
 that a coefficient of Paging has a zero standard error.
 As a consequence, it leads t-value of this parameter to infinity.
 This zero value can be interpreted in two different ways: an actual zero
 or treated as zero because significant digit is lost due to the floating
 point.
 Nevertheless, either way suggests that this model might not be a good model
 to use.
 The model might be overfitting with the training data.
 Therefore, model 1 which has the second lowest BIC is chosen for this given
 dataset instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Software release L16B
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although model 2 has the least BIC, its graph is not interpretable.
 There are divided into two main parts.
 As can be seen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "L16B_NNY"

\end_inset

, mostly observations in the first half of the period stay in State 3 while
 observations are in State 2 in the second half of the period.
 This seems somewhat unrealistic that observation i.e., software package stays
 in the same period for a long duration without switching to other states.
 The model 6 which has the second smallest BIC appears to have the same
 output like in model 2 although not reported.
 The selected model for this dataset is model 4.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Software release L17A
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model 1 has the lowest BIC and appears to have a good explanation when looking
 at the plot.
 Thus, it is preferably chosen.
