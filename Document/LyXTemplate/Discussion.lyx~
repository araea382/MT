\begin_layout Standard
In this analysis, a three-state model which had all switching coefficients
 from Analysis I (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:States"

\end_inset

) acted as a baseline model for each dataset.
 This model was used to compare with other models which had different combinatio
n of switching coefficients.
 If the compared model has higher BIC than the baseline model, its performance
 is concluded to be inferior and should not be considered for any further
 analysis.
 However, only examining the BIC when choosing a model for the data is insuffici
ent.
 Other aspects should also be taken into account along with the BIC such
 as model outputs and plots.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though model 3 had the lowest BIC, a coefficient of 
\emph on
Paging
\emph default
 in one state had a zero standard error which led t-value to infinity.
 This zero value can be interpreted as an actual zero or an extremely small
 value that a computer treated as zero because significant digit is lost.
 Nevertheless, either way suggests that this model is not a good model to
 be used with this dataset as the model might be overfitting with the training
 data.
 The standard error of zero means that there is no variation in the data
 i.e., every data value is equal to the mean value.
 Therefore, model 1 which had the second lowest BIC was chosen for this
 given dataset instead.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The t statistic is the coefficient divided by its standard error.
 The standard error is an estimate of the standard deviation of the coefficient,
 the amount it varies across cases.
 It can be thought of as a measure of the precision with which the regression
 coefficient is measured.
 If a coefficient is large compared to its standard error, then it is probably
 different from 0.

Models 2 and 6 had the lowest BIC among the other models.
 Nonetheless, their plots are similar to each other and provided a difficulty
 in interpreting results (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "L16B_NNY"

\end_inset

).
 Observations stay in State3 in the first half of the period but stay in
 State2 in the second half of the time period.
 There are continuous fluctuations of the CPU utilization value through
 out the whole time period.
 Therefore, for observations (or software packages) to remain in the same
 state for a long duration without switching to other states seem unrealistic.
 The selected model for this dataset was model 4 where its BIC was in the
 third lowest place.
 Even though model 4 had slightly higher BIC than models 2 and 6, the model
 produced more sensible result.

 State2 could be characterized as an

 The reason for this is because a decreasing pattern of the CPU utilization

 The test cases which are in State3 have either high or low in the CPU utilizati

 State3 contains the period of positive and negative peaks, and does not

 The CPU utilization values clearly decrease when test cases enter State2.
 These test cases often switch from State1, which is thought to be a state

\begin_layout Standard
A thorough search of relevant literature yielded that this thesis work might
 be the first time that Markov switching model has been applied to the data
 of CPU utilization.
 In previous works, this model was mainly applied with financial data or
 signal processing which were used as an inspiration for this study.
 However, because of differences in the characteristic of data, the procedure
 was slightly adjusted.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A large amount of time was spent on understanding the data, examining which
 variables had a significant impact on the CPU utilization, and determining
 which methods would provide the best possible outcome for this problem.
 Besides, after deciding on the most promising method, a lot of effort was
 invested studying implemented algorithms in the R package as well as modifying
 code as necessary.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, 
\emph on
NodeName
\emph default
, which is used to execute test cases, was assumed to be indifferent i.e.,
 performance of test cases are the same regardless of the machine.
 Therefore, selecting a minimum value of the CPU utilization of the test
 case for each software package in data preprocessing step is reasonable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Above all, one has to understand and accept a risk when deciding on the
 number of states as there is no guarantee how many states would yield the
 best outcome.
 This risk is also applied to a situation when determining the number of
 switching coefficients in the model.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

There is no fixed rules in deciding the number of states.
 Therefore, difference number of states were tried with the method in order
 to determine which number would be best for this analysis.
 The results from the model with two states offered less details and did
 not cover all happening situations.
 Furthermore, all the graphs of the two-state model are unrealistic and
 also difficult in interpret.

had one state with a considerably long period and another state with a very
 short period.
 There is a problematic interpretation when trying to make a rough inference
 on the derived states.
\end_layout

\end_inset

Despite higher BICs for the dataset of the software release L16B and L17A,
 three-state model provides more interpretable plots and better fit to the
 time series data.
 The four-state Markov switching model for each software release was also
 briefly tested in the analysis.
 Apparently, defining four states caused more difficulty when fitting the
 model and making an inference on the states.
 The results were rather poor when compare to the model with two and three
 states and was not include in the report.
 Higher number of states are more likely to give worse results and were
 not considered.
 Thus, the number of chosen states after applying Markov switching model
 to each dataset was three.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Switching"

\end_inset

, a hypothesis was made – test environment variable was possible to have
 a switching effect.
 The reason for that is because local events in 
\emph on
EventPerSec
\emph default
 is essential for each test case and should have flexible values in each
 of the fixed number of state.
 Having a constant value for these variables would be inadequate to characterize
 the whole time series data.
 On the contrary, the test environment does not necessarily require a switching
 mechanism.
 Although these test environment variables affect the CPU utilization, they
 do not need to have different values in each state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another thing worth mentioning is that when modeling the Markov switching
 model, it is better to try estimating a simple model first.
 The model's size grows exponentially according to the number of states
 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, and the number of predictor variables 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 In addition, if all coefficients have switching effects, the model will
 have more parameters to be estimated.
 The function in the package will try to fit the model and estimate coefficients
, but there is no guarantee that the obtained results of the likelihood
 will be a global maximum.
 As a consequence, the values of estimated coefficients cannot be completely
 trusted.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "perlin2015ms_regress"

\end_inset

 suggested any model with 
\begin_inset Formula $k>3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n\geq4$
\end_inset

 is not recommended.
 This is also one of the main reasons why not including all local events
 which were generated in each test case, and not making the model to have
 all switching coefficients.

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned previously in

, one variable in the dataset of the software release L16A

, which is an exact linear combination of the other variables,
\end_layout

\end_inset

 was excluded from the regression model.
 Fifty-seven observations in this dataset is used to train the Markov switching
 model.
 The dataset (or the number of test cases in the software release) is rather
 small which increases an occurrence of singularity.
 Therefore, unless there is more data, it is better to drop the variable
 from the regression model before doing a further analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each software release, each state in the model have a significantly
 high r-squared which are greater than 0.9 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Output"

\end_inset

).
 R-squared is an intuitive measure to determine how well the model fits
 the data.
 In general, the higher r-squared is the better.
 Nevertheless, high r-squared does not necessarily mean that the model fits
 the data well.
 R-square cannot determine whether the model is adequate or not.
 In order to assess this, the residual analysis is required.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
R-squared cannot determine whether the coefficient estimates and predictions
 are biased, which is why you must assess the residual plots.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One reason for getting a high r-squared is because of including many predictor
 variables to the model.
 R-squared increases when there are more terms in the model.
 Another reason, which is somehow a consequence of adding too many predictor
 variables, is that the model might be overfitting the data.
 As a result, the model produces misleading high r-squared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Q-Q plot is a visual check for an assumptiosteady n of normality which
 provides a rough idea whether or not the assumption is plausible.
 From residual analysis in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Residual"

\end_inset

, it revealed that residuals did not completely follow the normal distribution
 for all three datasets.
 This is not surprising as real data rarely have a well-defined structure.
 Since the Markov switching model assumed normal distributed residuals,
 the chosen models might have lesser in credibility in the results.
 However, recall that the dataset used in this thesis is not sufficiently
 large.
 With small samples, the Q-Q plot is often less clearer and difficult to
 spot a basic feature as it might represent more noise.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The assumption of a normally distributed residuals is justified for software
 release L16B.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If the residuals appear to behave randomly, it suggests that the model fits
 the data well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
randomness tends to obscure the actual behavior especially with small data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Furthermore, the model is able to capture the pattern of data rather well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The model seems to capture the dependent structure of the error terms in
 the time series, except for the reported significant lag.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
heavy tail = high variance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is an outlier in the residuals (2004:Q4) which suggests there was
 something unusual happening in that quarter.
 It would be worth investigating that outlier to see if there were any unusual
 circumstances or events that may have reduced beer production for the quarter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The remaining residuals show that the model has captured the patterns in
 the data quite well, although there is a small amount of autocorrelation
 left in the residuals (seen in the significant spike in the ACF plot).
 This suggests that the model can be slightly improved, although it is unlikely
 to make much difference to the resulting forecasts.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More importantly, the results of the Markov switching model could be affected
 by various types of bias.
 First of all, training the model with a small dataset.
 Due to a lack of data, the model will be less effective or unable to capture
 the behavior for new observations that lie outside the range of training
 data.
 For this reason, a prediction for the new observations might not be accurate
 as it should be.
 This is like what happened when making a state prediction for the software
 release L16A (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Predict"

\end_inset

).
 Second, other factors which are not considered in the model might also
 be the reason of causing a bias.
 The chosen predictor variables in this thesis are variables that have a
 partial prior knowledge and have been analyzed to have some significant
 impacts on CPU utilization.
 However, it is possible that there are still some explanatory information
 that is overlooked.
 Finally, selecting the number of states and switching coefficients in the
 model could cause a bias as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As described above, the small dataset is proven to cause several problems
 and difficulty to the analysis.
 The size of data is crucial in statistical analysis because more information
 can be extracted and used as an input for the model to learn.

A benefit from using a non-parametric analysis is that it does not require
 a prior assumption of a data distribution and is able to detect any type
 of distributional change within a time series.
 One noted behavior which can be seen from the results of the Markov switching
 model and the E-divisive method in the simulated data is that if a pattern
 of changing from one state to another state in the data is not obvious,
 the E-divisive method will be unable to detect locations of change points.
 For instance, the method could not identify any changes in the first hundred
 observations, and also at the end of the time series in the simulated Dataset

 Besides, the duration between states also affect the ability of discovering
 the change point locations in the E-divisive method.
 To illustrate, the switching pattern is considerably difficult to notice
 in the simulated Dataset 2.
 The period of staying in the state is short and there are many switches
 between states occur over the period of time.
 The shift for the response variable is not dramatic that one can see the
 huge difference when there is a switch in the state.
 Therefore, the E-divisive method could only detect two change point locations
 where the shifts were obvious.

After examining the results in both simulated datasets, the E-divisive method
 proved to have less power in detecting changes in the data.
 The E-divisive method and the Markov switching model appear to discover
 changes at around the same time when the actual changes occur, despite
 some false alarms and missed detections.
 This suggests that for the real data where the actual state is unknown,
 the actual changes might occur around locations where these two methods
 are able to detect.
 In addition, there is a high probability to be an actual change of the
 state if these two methods can identify the change point at the exact same
 location.

Note that when performing a Markov switching model, variables which have
 influences on the CPU utilization are also included in the model.
 Nonetheless, the E-divisive method only considers the values of the CPU
 utilization.
 With this difference, the E-divisive method will have even less power to
 identify actual changes in the CPU utilization.
 Since there are other variables that affect the value of the CPU utilization,
 it is insufficient to take into account only the response variable.

The E-divisive method appears to perform reasonably well in detecting changes
 as far as a non-parametric analysis could.
 As can be seen from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "subsec:Real-data"

\end_inset

, the method is able to detect when a change is happened around the same
 time as the Markov switching model did.
 Even though the E-divisive method might not provide the best result, it
 can give a general idea of estimated change points.

The state prediction function which is an additionsteady al implemented
 function in the package seems to work properly.

 The accuracy of the test set in the simulated Dataset 1 was significantly
 high.
 One reason for that might be because the simulated data had an obvious
 pattern in switching between states.

For example, the value of the CPU usage is moderately low if it is generated
 from the Good state.

Besides, each state remained in its own state for a while before switching
 to the other states.
 Therefore, the model can completely capture the behavior of the time series
 data.
 In contrast, the simulated Dataset 2 had several switches between states
 and each state did not have a long duration.
 Even though the pattern of the response variable is rather difficult to
 see in the plot, the Markov switching model still perform rather well for
 this dataset.
