\begin_layout Standard
In this analysis, a three-state model which had all switching coefficients
 from Analysis I (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:States"

\end_inset

) acted as a baseline model for each dataset.
 This model was used to compare with other models which had different combinatio
n of switching coefficients.
 If the compared model has higher BIC than the baseline model, its performance
 is concluded to be inferior and should not be considered for any further
 analysis.
 However, only examining the BIC when choosing a model for the data is insuffici
ent.
 Remark that BIC might be unreliable for a small or moderate dataset as
 BIC is derived under the assumption of a normal distributed data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, other aspects should also be taken into account along with the
 BIC such as model outputs and plots.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though model 3 had the lowest BIC, a coefficient of 
\emph on
Paging
\emph default
 in one state had a zero standard error which led t-value to infinity.
 This zero value can be interpreted as an actual zero or an extremely small
 value that a computer treated as zero because significant digit is lost.
 Nevertheless, either way suggests that this model is not a good model to
 be used with this dataset as the model might be overfitting with the training
 data.
 The standard error of zero means that there is no variation in the data
 i.e., every data value is equal to the mean value.
 Therefore, model 1 which had the second lowest BIC was chosen for this
 given dataset instead.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The t statistic is the coefficient divided by its standard error.
 The standard error is an estimate of the standard deviation of the coefficient,
 the amount it varies across cases.
 It can be thought of as a measure of the precision with which the regression
 coefficient is measured.
 If a coefficient is large compared to its standard error, then it is probably
 different from 0.

Models 2 and 6 had the lowest BIC among the other models.
 Nonetheless, their plots are similar to each other and provided a difficulty
 in interpreting results (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "L16B_NNY"

\end_inset

).
 Observations stay in State3 in the first half of the period but stay in
 State2 in the second half of the time period.
 There are continuous fluctuations of the CPU utilization value through
 out the whole time period.
 Therefore, for observations (or software packages) to remain in the same
 state for a long duration without switching to other states seem unrealistic.
 The selected model for this dataset was model 4 where its BIC was in the
 third lowest place.
 Even though model 4 had slightly higher BIC than models 2 and 6, the model
 produced more sensible result.

State inference

Another important task after the suitable model was decided is to make an
 inference on the derived states because the model output does not provide

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A function from the package will estimate coefficients in each state without
 providing the definition of these states.

 State2 could be characterized as an

 The reason for this is because a decreasing pattern of the CPU utilization

 The test cases which are in State3 have either high or low in the CPU utilizati

 State3 contains the period of positive and negative peaks, and does not

\begin_layout Standard
Even though the values of the CPU utilization which stay in State1 drop
 in some periods, there is an increase in the CPU utilization values in
 most of the periods.
 Hence, State1 could be defined as a 
\emph on
Degradation
\emph default
 state.
 The CPU utilization values clearly decrease when test cases enter State2.
 These test cases often switch from State1, which is thought to be a state
 where the performance of the test cases perform badly.
 As a consequence, this behavior indicates an improving in the test cases.
 Thus, State2 is defined as an 
\emph on

 On the contrary, the values of the CPU utilization for the test cases in
 State3 have an unclear pattern.
 The values are quite fluctuate and because of this behavior, the state

 State3 also contains a peak which occur in the time series data.

\begin_layout Standard
A thorough search of relevant literature yielded that this thesis work might
 be the first time that Markov switching model has been applied to the data
 of CPU utilization.
 In previous works, this model was mainly applied with financial data or
 signal processing which were used as an inspiration for this study.
 However, because of differences in the characteristic of data, the procedure
 was slightly adjusted.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A large amount of time was spent on understanding the data, examining which
 variables had a significant impact on the CPU utilization, and determining
 which methods would provide the best possible outcome for this problem.
 Besides, after deciding on the most promising method, a lot of effort was
 invested studying implemented algorithms in the R package as well as modifying
 code as necessary.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, 
\emph on
NodeName
\emph default
, which is used to execute test cases, was assumed to be indifferent i.e.,
 performance of test cases are the same regardless of the machine.
 Therefore, selecting a minimum value of the CPU utilization of the test
 case for each software package in data preprocessing step is reasonable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Above all, one has to understand and accept a risk when deciding on the
 number of states as there is no guarantee how many states would yield the
 best outcome.
 This risk is also applied to a situation when determining the number of
 switching coefficients in the model.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

There is no fixed rules in deciding the number of states.
 Therefore, difference number of states were tried with the method in order
 to determine which number would be best for this analysis.
 The results from the model with two states offered less details and did
 not cover all happening situations.
 Furthermore, all the graphs of the two-state model are unrealistic and
 also difficult in interpret.

had one state with a considerably long period and another state with a very
 short period.
 There is a problematic interpretation when trying to make a rough inference
 on the derived states.
\end_layout

\end_inset

Despite higher BICs for the dataset of the software release L16B and L17A,
 three-state model provides more interpretable plots and better fit to the
 time series data.
 The four-state Markov switching model for each software release was also
 briefly tested in the analysis.
 Apparently, defining four states caused more difficulty when fitting the
 model and making an inference on the states.
 The results were rather poor when compare to the model with two and three
 states and was not include in the report.
 Higher number of states are more likely to give worse results and were
 not considered.
 Thus, the number of chosen states after applying Markov switching model
 to each dataset was three.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among all the predictor variables, the local events variables in 
\emph on
EventPerSec
\emph default
 is more essential than the test environment variables.
 Having a constant value for the local events variables would be inadequate
 to characterize the whole time series data and its evolution.
 However, the test environment variables do not necessarily require a switching
 mechanism.
 This is why in this study, the test environment variable was possible to
 not have a switching effect.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

for each test case and should have flexible values in each of the fixed
 number of state.
 Although these test environment variables affect the CPU utilization, they
 do not need to have different values in each state.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another thing worth mentioning is that when modeling the Markov switching
 model, it is better to try estimating a simpler model first.
 The size of the model grows exponentially according to the number of states
 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, and the number of predictor variables 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 In addition, if all coefficients have switching effects, the model will
 have more parameters to be estimated.
 The function in the package will try to fit the model and estimate the
 value of the coefficients, but there is no guarantee that the obtained
 results of the likelihood will be a global maximum.
 As a consequence, the estimated values of the coefficients cannot be completely
 trusted.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 suggested any model with 
\begin_inset Formula $k>3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n\geq4$
\end_inset

 is not recommended.
 This is also the main reason why not all the local events were included,
 and the model was not made to have all the switching coefficients.

This problem could be reduced by increasing the size of the data.
 However, with a limited available data, fifty-seven observations in this
 dataset, the variable

 has to be dropped from the regression model before doing a further analysis.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Fifty-seven observations in this dataset were used to train the Markov switching
 model.
 The dataset (or the number of test cases in the software release) is rather
 small, which increases a probability of singularity occurrence.
 Therefore, unless there is more data, it is better to drop the variable
 from the regression model before doing a further analysis.

\begin_layout Standard
For each software release, each state in the model has a significantly high
 r-squared value which is greater than 0.9 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Output"

\end_inset

).
 R-squared value is an intuitive measurement to determine how well the model
 fits with the data.
 In general, the higher r-squared value is more preferable.
 Nevertheless, high r-squared value does not necessarily indicate that the
 model is a good model because the model with high r-squared value could
 be overfitting due to too many predictor variables were used in the model.
 Using only r-squared value to determine adequacy of the model can be misleading.
 A residual analysis should be considered when evaluating a model.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
R-squared cannot determine whether the coefficient estimates and predictions
 are biased, which is why you must assess the residual plots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
R-squared value cannot be solely used to indicate whether the model is adequate
 or not.
 In order to assess this, a residual analysis is required.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There are many factors that affect value of r-squared.
 One factor is the number of predictor variables in the model.
 R-squared value increases when there are more terms in the model.
 Another reason, which is somehow a consequence of adding too many predictor
 variables, is that the model might be overfitting the data.
 As a result, the model produces misleading high r-squared.

\begin_layout Standard
A Q-Q plot is a visual check for an assumption of normality.
 The plot provides a rough idea whether the assumption is plausible or not.
 From the residual analysis in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Residual"

\end_inset

, it revealed that the residuals of all three datasets did not completely
 follow the normal distribution.
 This is not surprising as real data rarely have a well-defined structure.
 Since the Markov switching model assumed normal distributed residuals,
 the chosen models might have less credible results.
 In addition, the dataset used in this thesis is not sufficiently large.
 As a result, the Q-Q plot is often unclear and difficult to spot its basic
 feature due to more noises.
 ACF and PACF plots are commonly used to check a randomness in a data and
 also to identify a possible structure of a time series data.
 The models of all three datasets seemed to capture the dependent structure
 of the error terms in the data, even though a small amount of autocorrelation
 were left in the residuals.
 Moreover, these plots indicate that an AR(1) is already justified for these
 datasets.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The assumption of a normally distributed residuals is justified for software
 release L16B.

randomness tends to obscure the actual behavior especially with small data

There is an outlier in the residuals (2004:Q4) which suggests there was
 something unusual happening in that quarter.
 It would be worth investigating that outlier to see if there were any unusual
 circumstances or events that may have reduced beer production for the quarter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The remaining residuals show that the model has captured the patterns in
 the data quite well, although there is a small amount of autocorrelation
 left in the residuals (seen in the significant spike in the ACF plot).
 This suggests that the model can be slightly improved, although it is unlikely
 to make much difference to the resulting forecasts.

More importantly, the results of the Markov switching model could be affected
 by various types of bias.
 Due to a small size of the training data, the training model will not be
 very effective and unable to capture the behaviors of new observations
 that lie outside the range of the training data.

 Secondly, only the predictor variables that have been analyzed to have
 significant impacts on the CPU utilization were included in the model.
 However, many other variables that is possible to have minor impact on
 the CPU utilization but were overlooked.
 Therefore, there might be some bias by not including these variables into
 the analysis.
 Finally, the criteria that has been used to select the number of states
 and the number of switching coefficients in the model are rather subjective.
 Hence, these chosen number might not be the best for different perspectives
 and so could be counted as one of the bias as well.

other factors which are not considered in the model might also be the reason
 of causing a bias.
 The chosen predictor variables in this thesis are variables that have a
 partial prior knowledge and have been analyzed to have some significant
 impacts on CPU utilization.
 However, it is possible that there are still some explanatory information
 that is overlooked.
 Finally, selecting the number of states and switching coefficients in the
 model could cause a bias as well.
 Finally, selecting the number of states and the number of switching coefficient

As described above, the small dataset is proven to cause several problems
 and difficulty to the analysis.
 The size of data is crucial in statistical analysis because more information
 can be extracted and used as an input for the model to learn.

A benefit of using a non-parametric analysis is that no assumption of the
 data distribution is required and all type of distributional change within
 a time series can be detected.
 One behavior found from the

and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is that if a pattern of a state in the data is not obvious, the E-divisive
 method will be unable to detect locations of the change points.
 For instance, the method could not identify any changes in the first hundred
 observations, and also at the end of the time series in the simulated Dataset
 1.

Besides, the duration that time series stays in one state also affects the
 ability of the E-divisive method to discover the change point locations.
 In the simulated Dataset 2, many switches between states occur over the
 time period.
 As a result, the period of staying in each state is short.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This is more clear when examining the results in the simulated Dataset
 2 where the E-divisive method could only detect two change point locations.
 If the response variable value fluctuates but the average value does not
 change drastically, the E-divisive method will not be able to identify
 the state change.

To illustrate, the switching pattern is considerably difficult to notice
 in the simulated Dataset 2.
 The period of staying in the state is short and there are many switches
 between states occur over the period of time.
 The shift for the response variable is not dramatic that one can see the
 huge difference when there is a switch in the state.
 Therefore, the E-divisive method could only detect two change point locations
 where the shifts were obvious.

The E-divisive method proved to have less power in detecting changes in
 the data.
 The Markov switching model and the E-divisive method appear to discover
 changes at around the same time when the actual changes occur, despite
 some false alarms and missed detections.
 This suggests that for the real data where the actual state is unknown,
 the actual changes might occur around locations where these two methods
 are able to detect.
 In addition, there is a high probability to be an actual change of the
 state if these two methods can identify the change point at the exact same
 location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that when performing the Markov switching model, variables which have
 influences on the CPU utilization are also included in the model.
 Nonetheless, the E-divisive method only considers the values of the CPU
 utilization.
 With this difference, the E-divisive method will have even less power to
 identify actual changes in the CPU utilization.
 Since there are other variables that affect the value of the CPU utilization,
 it is insufficient to take into account only the response variable.

The E-divisive method appears to perform reasonably well in detecting changes
 as far as a non-parametric analysis could.
 As can be seen from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Real-data"

\end_inset

, the method is able to detect when a change is happened around the same
 time as the Markov switching model did.
 Even though the E-divisive method might not provide the best result, it
 can give a general idea of estimated change points.

The state prediction function which is an additional implemented function

.
 The accuracy of the test set in the simulated Dataset 1 was significantly
 high.
 One reason for that might be because the simulated data had an obvious
 pattern in switching between states.

For example, the value of the CPU usage is moderately low if it is generated
 from the Good state.
\end_layout

Besides, each state remained in its own state for a while before switching
 to the other states.
 Therefore, the model can completely capture the behavior of the time series
 data.
 In contrast, the simulated Dataset 2 had several switches between states
 and each state did not have a long duration.
 Even though the pattern of the response variable is rather difficult to
 see in the plot, the Markov switching model still perform rather well for
 this dataset.
