- perhaps use the same idea as in its introduction to write mine.. :)

- Plot visual inspection could reveal the existence of marked changes in the time series, which can be further investigated by statistical procedures. 
- Onoz and Bayazit (2003) showed that the parametric t-test has less power than the non-parametric Mann–Kendall test when the probability distribution is skewed, but that, in practical applications, they can be used interchangeably, with identical results in most cases.

- represents a logical course of action when performing changepoint analysis on data of no known distributional form, a common scenario that applies to a wide variety of real-world processes 
- Changepoint detection methods can be further categorised into the parametric class, which incorporates distributional knowledge of the data into the detection scheme, and nonpara- metric class, which makes no such distributional assumptions regarding the data 
- However, since many real-world processes do not exhibit well-defined behavour, alternative methods are required that do not make such restrictive assumptions (Hawkins and Deng, 2010). 
- a change should be flagged as soon as possible in order to deal effectively with the consequences of such a change 
- The need for nonparametric methods in sequential testing is vast as the assumption of a known distributional form is usually violated, particularly as the data is processed in real-time 
- Because the precise control of the false alarm rate is
essential in change detection problems, parametric tests based on normality may not be
suitable in data sequences that are not normally distributed.
- the nonparametric test is the preferred method when analysing data
arising from a real-world process, as the assumption of normality is too restrictive, particularly in
sequential testing
