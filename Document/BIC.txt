All this illustrates why BIC does not choose the right model (results of Tables 2,
3 and 7): if the regimes are not properly identified, the estimation will be less accurate and the value of
the likelihood function lower. Thus, AIC and BIC have higher values and become inaccurate in selecting
the model. The loss functions computed with the true volatility are not affected by the likelihood value
and are more efficient than the information criteria.
